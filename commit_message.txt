Fix nested embed type FQN generation for BinaryReaders/Writers

- IR builder: Pass owner FQN to convert_field_to_ir for correct type resolution
- BinaryWriters template: Add find_embedded_struct check for proper namespace-level method calls
- Add parent_type_path field to TypeRef (currently unused, reserved for future use)

This fixes C# compilation errors where nested embed types like Monster.DropItems.Enchantment
were incorrectly referenced as Monster.Enchantment in generated BinaryReaders/Writers.

Verified: All tests passing (11 snapshots updated), C# compilation 0 errors
